### Finding 2 - Will World Cup Increase the GDP of Host Countries? Probably not!

World cup is not only about sports glory, it also influences the economy, in this finding, we'll focuses on the argument that whether world cup will lead an economic increase to the host countries.

We selected 13 countries of 14 world cup games since 1960, including Chile(1962), United Kingdom(1966), Mexico(1970), Germany(1974), Argentina(1978), Spain(1982), Mexico(1986), Italy(1990), United States(1994), France(1998), Korea(2002), Japan(2002), Germany(2006), South Africa(2010), Brazil(2014).

#### <1> Compare GDP Growth Rate of Host Countries

If the World Cup does provide an economic boost, we might expect to see an increase in the growth of a nation's gross domestic product (GDP) either in the World Cup year or in the immediate aftermath. But after the analysis, we found that hosting World Cup might be not very profitable!

**Figure 1: Average and Median Growth in Real Gross Domestic Product Host Countries (1960-2016)**

The below Figure 1 presents the growth rate of GDP in **the five years prior to the World Cup (Pre: Y-5 to Host Year) and compares that to the growth rate in the World Cup host year, as well as the five-year periods following (Post: Host year to Y5)**.

The graph shows the **average and the median growth rates** of all the host countries in five years prior to and the five years after the World Cup event. And this discussion could be interpreted as being suggestive of possible trends, not as conclusive evidence one way or the other about the causal impact of the World Cup on national economies.

It is interesting to find that on average, economic growth is slower in the host year than in the years both preceding and following. In other words, World Cup hosts have seen a negative impact on economic growth in the year of the event. With the World Cup games lasting about one month in total, the distraction of such a large sporting event might be enough to slow economic growth.

On the other hand, the data suggests that host countries might recover nicely in the two years immediately following the World Cup with average growth rates that are higher than the years immediately preceding it.

In the revised version, we removed the average line as its not informative, and remove the data point markd and change the color to make the graph more clear.

#### <2> GDP Annual Changes in Current US$

**Figure 2.1: GDP Changes Among Host Countries (1960-2016)**

When we compared the GDP change in current $US, we can see the big differences among these host countries. Countries like the U.S., Germany and Japan are known as large economies, did show a rising trend after host year as we can see from the following graph.

Germany (2006), France (1998) and the United States (1994), with developed infrastructure and modern stadiums, spent less than a billion each. When South Korea and Japan co-hosted in 2002 and built new facilities, South Korea spent [$2.5 billion](http://time.com/2930699/world-cup-brazil-spending/)and Japan [$5 billion](http://time.com/2930699/world-cup-brazil-spending/).But it's not obvious to draw conclusion for other countries.

In the revised version, according to the audience suggestions, we change the color to highlight the lines we want to emphasis so it will be more clear, in this graph, we highlighted the large economies and will leave explanations of other countries to the next graph.

**Figure 2.2: GDP Changes Among Host Countries (Medium Economies, 1960-2016)** 
  
As the huge GDP gaps between countries, we cannot really see what happended to country with GDP below 2 trillons. So by filtering out large economies, we can see from the following graph, after host year, Brazil has a significant drop. Possible reasons could be: inflation, cost of [infrustration](http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/22/news/economy/world-cup-brazil/index.html), these are all possile reasons to cause negtive impact of GDP.

This World Cup of Brazil is actually the most expensive one yet, with estimates of Brazil's total expenditures hovering around $14 billion including more than $3.6 billion spent on 12 new and renovated stadiums. 

In the revised version, according to the audience suggestions, we change the color to highlight the lines we want to emphasis, in this graph, we highlighted Brazil as it have an obvious opposite trend with others.

**Figure 2.3: GDP Changes among Host Countries (Small Economies, 1960-2016)**
  
There is an obvious economic boosting for South Africa, as the only country in Africa ever host the world cup, this event was seen as an African achievement. 

Also, it was a remarkable transition for the nation that had been banned from the global tournament by FIFA in 1961. South Africa was hoping that the opportunity to host the biggest spectacle in the world would be an opportunity to continue its societal transformation and economic development.(references: Economic and Social Impact of the World Cup on South Africa)

South Africa directly spent over 4 billion dollars to host the cup (Cohen 2010), and billions more in corresponding infrastructure improvements in host cities (Desal and Vahed 2010, 156). In all, the government spent over R13 billion on infrastructure and transportation improvements. This spending directly created 130,000 construction jobs (Marcus, 2010), and the World Cup as a whole indirectly resulted in a gain of 415,000 jobs (Sylvester and Harju 2010, 8).

In the revised version, we highlighted South Africa as it have an increase trend and start to drop one year after World Cup. So when we observe the graph, we wondered could this has anything to do with the cost? So we gathered information of the cost from news:

![](https://github.com/gleamingMushroom/AddImage/blob/master/Picture1.png)

Germany (2006), France (1998) and the United States (1994), with developed infrastructure and modern stadiums, spent less than a billion each. When South Korea and Japan co-hosted in 2002 and built new facilities, South Korea spent $2.5 billion and Japan $5 billion. 2010 World Cup in South Africa cost a total of $3.9 billion. The most expensive one is Brazil, with estimates of total expenditures hovering around $14 billion. 

#### Limitations and Outlook:

+ As stated above, drawing general conclusion from GDP data is very difficult. Different nations have had a variety of experiences, so the discussion above should be interpreted as being suggestive of possible trends, not as conclusive evidence one way or the other about the causal impact of the World Cup on national economies.
+ As popularity of the sport has increased worldwide, we might expect a changing impact of the World Cup on economies, so the past is not necessarily a good guide for the future. (With over 4 billion followers of football, it is by far the most popular sport in the world. [Reference](https://www.totalsportek.com/most-popular-sports/)
+ The impact of the games might also be sensitive to the timing of the games. A country that is operating below capacity might receive a much bigger boost from the games than an economy that is already growing.
