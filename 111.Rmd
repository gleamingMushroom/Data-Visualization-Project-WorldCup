### Finding 2 - Will World Cup Increase the GDP of Host Countries? Probably not!

World cup is not only about sports glory, it also influences the economy, in this finding, we'll focuses on the argument that whether world cup will lead an economic increase to the host countries.

We selected 13 countries of 14 world cup games since 1960, including Chile(1962), United Kingdom(1966), Mexico(1970), Germany(1974), Argentina(1978), Spain(1982), Mexico(1986), Italy(1990), United States(1994), France(1998), Korea(2002), Japan(2002), Germany(2006), South Africa(2010), Brazil(2014).

#### <1> Compare GDP Growth Rate of Host Countries

If the World Cup does provide an economic boost, we might expect to see an increase in the growth of a nation's gross domestic product (GDP) either in the World Cup year or in the immediate aftermath. But after the analysis, we found that hosting World Cup might be not very profitable!

**Figure 1: Average and Median Growth in Real Gross Domestic Product Host Countries (1960-2016)**

The below Figure 1 presents the growth rate of GDP in **the five years prior to the World Cup (Pre: Y-5 to Host Year) and compares that to the growth rate in the World Cup host year, as well as the five-year periods following (Post: Host year to Y5)**.

The graph shows the **average and the median growth rates** of all the host countries in five years prior to and the five years after the World Cup event. And this discussion could be interpreted as being suggestive of possible trends, not as conclusive evidence one way or the other about the causal impact of the World Cup on national economies.

It is interesting to find that on average, economic growth is slower in the host year than in the years both preceding and following. In other words, World Cup hosts have seen a negative impact on economic growth in the year of the event. With the World Cup games lasting about one month in total, the distraction of such a large sporting event might be enough to slow economic growth.

On the other hand, the data suggests that host countries might recover nicely in the two years immediately following the World Cup with average growth rates that are higher than the years immediately preceding it.

In the revised version, we removed the average line as its not informative, and change the color to make the graph 

#### <2> GDP Annual Changes in Current US$

When we compared the GDP change in current $US, we can see the big differences among these host countries. Countries like the U.S., Germany and Japan are known as large economies, did show a rising trend after host year.

Germany (2006), France (1998) and the United States (1994), with developed infrastructure and modern stadiums, spent less than a billion each. When they co-hosted in 2002 and built new facilities, South Korea spent [$2.5 billion](http://time.com/2930699/world-cup-brazil-spending/)and Japan [$5 billion](http://time.com/2930699/world-cup-brazil-spending/).But it's not obvious to draw conclusion for other countries.

By filtering out large economies, we can see from the following graph, after host year, Brazil has a significant drop. Possible reasons could be: inflation, cost of [infrustration](http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/22/news/economy/world-cup-brazil/index.html)

This World Cup is the most expensive one yet, with estimates of Brazil's total expenditures hovering around $14 billion including more than $3.6 billion spent on 12 new and renovated stadiums. That's right around three times the estimated price tags for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, which cost a total of [$3.9 billion](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/06/27/is-hosting-world-cup-worth-it-no-so-why-do-it-good-question.html)with $1.3 billion in stadium construction work.

There is an obvious economic boosting for South Africa, as the only country in Africa ever host the world cup, this event was seen as an African achievement. 

Also, it was a remarkable transition for the nation that had been banned from the global tournament by FIFA in 1961. South Africa was hoping that the opportunity to host the biggest spectacle in the world would be an opportunity to continue its societal transformation and economic development.(references: Economic and Social Impact of the World Cup on South Africa)

South Africa directly spent over 4 billion dollars to host the cup (Cohen 2010), and billions more in corresponding infrastructure improvements in host cities (Desal and Vahed 2010, 156). In all, the government spent over R13 billion on infrastructure and transportation improvements. This spending directly created 130,000 construction jobs (Marcus, 2010), and the World Cup as a whole indirectly resulted in a gain of 415,000 jobs (Sylvester and Harju 2010, 8). 

Ultimately, the World Cup added 0.5% or R93 billion to South Africa's GDP in 2010 (Ibid). ([1] Fully judging the economic consequences of the World Cup is difficult, because the whole story of gains may not be finished yet. In their 2011 research paper, Ant??n, Alonso, and Rodr??guez found that economic growth in host nations is highest during the two years after having hosted the World Cup, and suggest that the overall picture for South Africa will be an even more positive one. So a broad timescale may be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.)

**Cost of Hosting World Cup**
Germany (2006), France (1998) and the United States (1994), with developed infrastructure and modern stadiums, spent less than a billion each. 
When South Korea and Japan co-hosted in 2002 and built new facilities, South Korea spent $2.5 billion and Japan $5 billion.
2010 World Cup in South Africa cost a total of $3.9 billion.
The most expensive one is Brazil, with estimates of total expenditures hovering around $14 billion.

#### Limitations and Outlook:

+ As stated above, drawing general conclusion from GDP data is very difficult. Different nations have had a variety of experiences, so the discussion above should be interpreted as being suggestive of possible trends, not as conclusive evidence one way or the other about the causal impact of the World Cup on national economies.
+ As popularity of the sport has increased worldwide, we might expect a changing impact of the World Cup on economies, so the past is not necessarily a good guide for the future. (With over 4 billion followers of football, it is by far the most popular sport in the world. [Reference](https://www.totalsportek.com/most-popular-sports/)
+ The impact of the games might also be sensitive to the timing of the games. A country that is operating below capacity might receive a much bigger boost from the games than an economy that is already growing.
+ GDP data has huge gap between different countries, find more supportive data to explain their changes in different ways.
