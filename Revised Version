The Unites States has prolems with gun violence, we talked about it after mass shootings and tragic news, but we might never fully understand how critical and complicated it is now. Here is the least you should know about gun violence problems:


### 1412 Mass shootings happened in the U.S. since 2014

There have been more than **1,400** mass shootings happened from 2014 to present. **1,629** people were killed and **6,063** were injured. 

On the night of Sunday, October 1, 2017 when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, leaving 59 people dead and 851 injured. 

The incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. It reignited the debate about gun laws in the U.S., with attention focused on bump fire stocks, which Paddock used to fire semi-automatic rifles at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon.

As we can see from the graph, unsurprisingly, mass shootings happended more often at areas with larger population, especially west coast and east area.

### People getting hurt everyday

On average, there is around one kill and three injury for each day in the US by mass shooting. Only 4 months passed by the time of this year, there are already **80** incidents happended.

**121** days, mass shooting has cost the US **103** killed and **314** injured.

As we can see from the numbers and trend, it is not getting better year after year!

### Weak Gun Laws, More Gun Deaths

There is an obviously correlation between gun laws and gun deaths, the graph below shows the ranking of gun laws strength versus gun death state by state (year 2017). Of the states with the strongest gun laws are associated with low gun death rates and low gun law grades with high gun death rates.

How is the gun laws strength measured? Six policies would be most essencial: Background Checks, Child Access Prevention, Concealed Carry Permitting, Domestic Violence, Extreme Risk Protection Order and Military-style Weaponry. For example, California has strongest gun conrtol laws of these six policies among 50 states, and ranked 43 of gun death rate for 50 represents fewest 0 represents most deaths.(This x-aixs has reverse the numbers for easier understanding, the data points move more right indicates high death rate.)

This year, 12 states increased their gun law scores over previous years. North Dakota, New Jersey, Nevada, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Utah passed new domestic violence laws, while Oregon enacted an Extreme Risk Protection Order law. California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York earned extra points for funding urban gun violence reduction programs, which are remarkably effective, non-legislative approaches to preventing shootings.
