## Project Introduction

The topic for this project is Gun Violence in the United States. The data products displayed below are inspired by an article of Vox -- [America's unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts). 

This project contains two parts: An redesign of existing data product and a deceptive data product. The objective is to learn from others, sharpen the critical perspective on data visualizations, reason about design decisions, and attempt to improve data visualizations.


## Redesign Data Product

The Unites States has prolems with gun violence, we talked about it after mass shootings and tragic news, but we might never fully understand how critical and complicated it is now. Here is the least you should know about gun violence problems:

### Finding 1 - 1412 Mass shootings happened in the U.S. since 2014

There have been more than **1,400** mass shootings happened from 2014 to present. **1,629** people were killed and **6,063** were injured. 

As we can see from the following graphs, the data used by the original one was a bit outdated, after improving it to the first version graph by using more latest data and adding the states' population, it shows mass shootings happended more often at areas with larger population, especially west coast and east area. But it's not unpredictable to the audience, so in the revised version, instead of showing incidents on its actual location, using sum of each states and removing the population data, the graph become more clear. 

The darkest incident can be seen from the graph was on the night of Sunday, October 1, 2017 when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, leaving 59 people dead and 851 injured. 

The incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. It reignited the debate about gun laws in the U.S., with attention focused on bump fire stocks, which Paddock used to fire semi-automatic rifles at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon.

### Finding 2 - People are getting hurt EVERDAY

On average, there is around one kill and three injury for each day in the US by mass shooting. Only 4 months passed by the time of this year, there are already **80** incidents happended. In 2018, **121** days, mass shooting has cost the US **103** killed and **314** injured.

In order to see these trend clearly, first version was trying to recreate a calendar and showing the rising trend by bar chart, but it's actually not intuitive to audience. 

In the revised version, using the incidents happened in 2018 as timeline graph and data from 2014 to 2017 indicates the trend, it's obvious that this situation are not getting better, the terrible numbers that grow with each mass shooting year after year, and surprisingly, for each year, Q3 always reached the peak of the year.

### Finding 3 - Weak Gun Laws, More Gun Deaths

There is an obviously correlation between gun laws and gun deaths -- fewer People die from gun violence in states with strong gun laws. But unfortunately, original graph from [Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) as cited below does not clearly show this correlation, there are pros and cons of using maps to visualise data, in this case, scatter plot allows the reader to make much more sense of the data than the map did. 

The first version graph using the ranking of gun laws strength versus gun death state by state (year 2017). It can be seen that the states with the strongest gun laws are associated with low gun death rates and low gun law grades with high gun death rates. Apart from too much colors, there is another ambiguous part: the x-aixs has reverse the numbers for easier understanding, the data points move more right indicates high death rate. 

So in the revised version, by improving the data to annual state gun death rates per 100,000 people in order of gun law strength and grouped by grade, which is more clear and no need to reverse x-aixs' numbers. Instead of using 10 different colors represents the law strength, narrowing it to 5 different shapes seems more direct and easier to understand. It is now clearly can be seen that around half of states with weak gun laws has high gun death rates.

How is the gun laws strength measured? Six policies would be most essencial: Background Checks, Child Access Prevention, Concealed Carry Permitting, Domestic Violence, Extreme Risk Protection Order and Military-style Weaponry. For example, California has strongest gun conrtol laws of these six policies among 50 states, and ranked 43 of gun death rate for 50 represents fewest 0 represents most deaths.

This year, 12 states increased their gun law scores over previous years. North Dakota, New Jersey, Nevada, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Utah passed new domestic violence laws, while Oregon enacted an Extreme Risk Protection Order law. California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York earned extra points for funding urban gun violence reduction programs, which are remarkably effective, non-legislative approaches to preventing shootings.

## Deceptive Data Product

**[Deceptive Visualization](https://medium.com/@Infogram/study-asks-how-deceptive-are-deceptive-visualizations-8ff52fd81239):** "a graphical depiction of information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies from the actual message."

This Part is a deceptive visualization data product inspired by the same article of Vox -- [America's unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts). It is propose to sharpen the skills in detecting intentional and unintentional distortions to the data.

Let's see the following comparisons of the original graph versus the decptive ones:

### Finding 4 - Have gun homicides really declined in the US over the past few years?

The article stated that gun homicides have declined over the past couple decades, we can see from the original graph that it did appeare a great and sudden drop, especially since 1993, the death rate of homicides decreased and tended to be stable.

But if our data start from 1999, the meaning could be completely different. 

The first version of deceptive graph took the same dataset, but different time period, and also the axis start point was manipulated, so the trend seems fluctuated remarkably. It can be seen that the death rate of homicides is tumultuous, goes up and down, with a decline around 2007 - 2011, and goes up from 2014 - 2016, eventually exceed the start year number.

But the first version displayed a volatile line, which not creating an obvious contrast with the original graph. So in the revised version, using the same y-axis range and showing the data points in the uniform way with the original graph, we can see that the death rate of homicides started to level off since 1999, a much smaller increase in the end of the line.

### Finding 5 - Most gun deaths are suicides?

The original graph shows majority of gun-related deaths in the US are suicides. We can see that line of suicides is much higher than homicides and still on a rising trend.

But if we change the graph to a different pattern, it could be visually tricked. The deceptive graph does not oppose the conclusion of *"greater access to guns dramatically increases the risk of suicide"*, but with the distorted area size and truncated y-axis, the visual effects are different. In the revised version, by increasing the contrast intentionally leave an misleading impression that the number of homecide is higher than suicide.

### Finding 6 - States with more guns have more gun deaths?

The original graph believes *"within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide."*

Using the same data from a study in Injury Prevention and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if we reverse the axis orientation, it could be visually deceptive. But also would be a very obvious method.

So in the revised version, instead of using death rate per 100,000 people, altering the way of calculation, using actual number of deaths, we can see the revised graph shows an opposite trend line, it could be interpreted as "there are no correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths".

## Data Processing and Wrangling

The data uesd in this projects are generated from different public data sources. 

Data of deaths caused by firearm by states is downloaded from CDC Multiple Cause of Death Data: https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html. The data represented firearm caused death in each state each year, from 1999 to 2016.

## Summary & Outlook

This is a course project of MSIS 2629 Dashboard, Scorecards, and Data Visualization at Santa Clara University. For each part, it visualizes three aspects of the original data, try to find out some interesting, non-trivial,and unexpected findings. It helps both author and audience to understand more about what is (in)effective data visulization and know the way to detect deceptive data products.

**Limitations and future improvement:** This project focused on the incidents happened in the US, it would be better to generate more data from different countries. As only with more comparisons of different countries will make the unique problems in the US more standout.
